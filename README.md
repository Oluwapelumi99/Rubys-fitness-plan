# Design
# Color Scheme
The colors used for this project are rgb(234, 206, 211) and rgb(219, 86, 108) for the header and footer background color.

The home page and meal plan page uses a background picture from www.pexels.com. 




On the sign in, sign-up and sign out buttons, The background color when the mouse hovers over it is rgb(219, 86, 108)and text color is #000000; after hover background color is set back torgb(189, 79, 98); and remains the same. 

All links text on this app have been set to inherit the text color on the page and text decoration is none. This makes the links on the page blend with the othrt texts on the page without making the link texts cluter the page and make the page look out of place.

# Typography
The prefered font used is 'Lato' and sans-serif has been added as a fall back incase the browser does not load the prefered font.

# Imagery
Image used on all the pages matches the theme of the site. Image is seen below. It is gotten from https://www.pexels.com

# Lighthouse
- I confrimed that the colors and font chosen are easy to read and accessible by running it through lighthose in dev tools. And I also made sure all buttons were asseccible by screen readers by adding an aria-label attribute to each button and image.
